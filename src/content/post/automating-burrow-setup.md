Life is too short to spend time manually installing software whenever you get
a new machine.  So I wrote a comprehensive [script](github.com/khargosh/burrow/)
that automates this for *me*.

To use the script, simply run this:

    $ curl -fsSL http://j.mp/khargosh > /tmp/khargo.sh
    $ bash /tmp/khargo.sh

Logs will be written to `/tmp/khargosh_config.log`.

Happy hacking!
